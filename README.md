# Request Queue Ticketing System

The Request Queue Ticketing System is a Systems Analysis and Design term project. It is made with C# using WinForms and the DBMS is SQL Server 2014. This program automates the ticketing and the requesting process for the stakeholders of Mapua Institute of Technology. An example use of this program is when a professor wants a computer in his/her room be fixed. He/She will go to a clerk with access to this program and request it to the proper personnels. The professor can check the completion of the request.

# Flow

  There are two modes of the program depending on its user: (a) administrative (b) executive. The administrative mode is assigned to a front-desk officer. He/She receives request and contact information from a requesting body. He/She then assigns the request and send the contact information to the proper department personnel. The program generates a ticket code for the requesting body so he/she can track the completion of the request. The administrative officer can also check the progress of the request completion based on the ticket code given to the requesting body. 
  
  On the other hand, the executive mode of the program are for department personnels that must perform the request. Once the administrative officer assigns the request to the department personnel, the request goes to the queue list exclusive for that personnel. The personnel can decline or accept the request.
